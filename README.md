# HiveCompute
The following code is part of the Bachelor's Thesis called "Design and implementation of a distributed scientific computing system using web browsers and household devices". It is not recommended to use it in a production environment, since it is necessary to optimize the code and carry out exhaustive analysis to guarantee its security.

## What is it?
This project is born as a result of the lack of resources in many areas of science, and of the difficulties that this entails in order to carry out "small" research or that do not receive sufficient funding in many cases.

The project aims to create a heterogeneous distributed scientific computing system for scientific research, using web browsers of everyday devices. Thanks to this system, the research staff attached to the initiative will be able to create projects within the platform and upload tasks to it, which will be solved simultaneously in a distributed manner by users from all over the world who want to collaborate by contributing the surplus computing capacity of their home devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets...).
